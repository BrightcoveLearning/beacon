    <p>When creating a page you are first asked to enter a title for the page, then asked to choose a page type:</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure">
      <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/pages/using-page-types/page-types-create-page.png" alt="">
    </figure>
    <p>This document will focus on the page types, their functionality and appearance. For information on the entire page creation process see the <a href="/pages/creating-managing-pages.html">Creating and Managing Pages</a> document.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Playlist_Grid">Playlist Grid</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Playlist Grid</strong> displays one or more playlists in grids, meaning thumbnails for all the videos in the playlist will appear on the page. If multiple playlists are selected the playlists names will appear as tabs at the top of the app page, as shown here:</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure">
      <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/pages/using-page-types/playlist-grid-wide.png" alt="grid page">
    </figure>
    <p>Note that if only one playlist is displayed no playlist name will appear. In this case, you would want to be sure the page name reflected the content of the playlist.</p>
    <p>The page type is responsive, the following screenshot shows the same previous page shown but at a narrower browser width. Note the the thumbnails are only four across whereas in the wider browser they were five across.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure">
      <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/pages/using-page-types/playlist-grid-narrow.png" alt="narrower grid">
    </figure>
