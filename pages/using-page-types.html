    <h2 id="Page_creation_process">Page creation process</h2>
    <p>When creating a page you are first asked to enter a title for the page, then asked to choose a page type:</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure">
      <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/pages/using-page-types/page-types-create-page.png" alt="">
    </figure>
    <p>This document will focus on the page types, their functionality and appearance. For information on the entire page creation process see the <a href="/pages/creating-managing-pages.html">Creating and Managing Pages</a> document.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Playlist_Grid">Playlist Grid</h2>
    <p>Note the following about the <strong>Playlist Grid</strong> type pages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The <strong>Playlist Grid</strong> displays one or more playlists in grids, meaning thumbnails for all the videos in the playlist will appear on the page. If multiple playlists are selected the playlists names will appear as tabs at the top of the app page, as shown here:
        <figure class="bcls-figure">
          <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/pages/using-page-types/playlist-grid-wide.png" alt="grid page">
        </figure>
      </li>
      <li>Note that if only one playlist is displayed no playlist name will appear. In this case, you would want to be sure the page name reflected the content of the playlist.</li>
      <li>
        The page type is responsive. The following screenshot shows the same page previously shown, but at a narrower browser width. Note the the thumbnails are only four across whereas in the wider browser they were five across.
        <figure class="bcls-figure">
          <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/pages/using-page-types/playlist-grid-narrow.png" alt="narrower grid">
        </figure>
      </li>
      <li>
        If the number of playlists added to the page makes the playlist name tabs wider than space available, an arrow is added to the right side of the tab list to provide a way to see all the tabs, as shown here:
        <figure class="bcls-figure">
          <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/pages/using-page-types/many-tabs.png" alt="arrow for tabs">
        </figure>
        Once you reach the end, the arrow appears on the left side.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Hero_Autoplay_Channel">Hero (Autoplay Channel)</h2>
    <p>Note the following about the <strong>>Hero (Autoplay Channel)</strong> type pages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Feature a channel as fullscreen, autoplaying video. Play the following video to see the behavior.
        <iframe src="https://players.brightcove.net/1752604059001/default_default/index.html?videoId=1700212308193411817" allowfullscreen="" allow="encrypted-media" width="790" height="400"></iframe>
      </li>
      <li>Additional playlists display as carousels.</li>
      <li>Valid video content for the playlist with channel are:
        <ul>
          <li>A Brightcove Beacon channel</li>
          <li>A Cloud Playout channel created in Studio</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The page is responsive. The playing video reduces in size and the carousels' thumbnails shrink in size and fewer are displayed.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Hero_Featured_Playlist">Hero (Featured Playlist)</h2>
    <p>Note the following about the <strong>Hero (Featured Playlist)</strong> type pages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The featured playlist appears at the top of the page with its thumbnails larger within a carousel than other playlists' thumbnails on the page, as shown here:
        <figure class="bcls-figure">
          <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/pages/using-page-types/hero-playlist-wide.png" alt="hero playlist wide">
        </figure>
      </li>
      <li>As seen in the screenshot just above, additional playlists added to the page display below the featured playlist in carousels, using smaller thumbnails.</li>
      <li>The page type is responsive. The following screenshot shows the same page previously shown, but at a narrower browser width. Note the the thumbnails are only two across for the featured playlist whereas in the wider browser they were three across.
        <figure class="bcls-figure">
          <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/pages/using-page-types/hero-playlist-narrow.png" alt="hero playlist narrow">
        </figure>
      </li>
    </ul>
