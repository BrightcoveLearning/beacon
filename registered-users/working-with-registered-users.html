    <p>Registered users are users who have signed in or authenticated with your Brightcove Beacon app. If one of your registered users has a question or a problem with their account, you can quickly look them up using a smart search, and verify their details. User information can be found in the following tab sections:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Overview</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Viewing history</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Transactions</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Active sessions</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Profiles</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Quick actions</strong> allow you to perform a global action from any of the tab screens.</p>
