    <p>In this Limited Availability release, not all the functionality from Video Cloud Studio and Beacon Classic has been rolled into Beacon Studio. To be sure the different tools are clearly understood, here are partial screenshots of each:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
      <li>Beacon Studio
        <figure class="bcls-figure">
          <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/general/multiple-tools/beacon-studio.png" alt="beacon studio">
        </figure>
      </li>
      <li>Beacon Classic
        <figure class="bcls-figure">
          <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/general/multiple-tools/beacon-classic.png" alt="beacon classic">
        </figure>
      </li>
      <li>Video Cloud Studio
        <figure class="bcls-figure">
          <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/general/multiple-tools/vcs.png" alt="Video Cloud Studio">
        </figure>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Any documents that include steps where you have to use a tool other than Beacon Studio, it will be stated near the top of the page similar to this:</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure">
      <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/general/multiple-tools/note.png" alt="note">
    </figure>
    <p>The note will read if you need to use Beacon Classic and/or Video Cloud Studio. If you do not see this note, the steps in the doc (if any) are done with Beacon Studio.</p>
