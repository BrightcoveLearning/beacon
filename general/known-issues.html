    <h3>Stream limitations and rapid switching between videos</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>If a viewer switches quickly between videos it is possible the error shown here may be displayed:

          <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/general/known-issues/stream-limitations.png" alt="stream-limitations">
        </figure>
        <p>This occurs because it takes a number of seconds for the stream to be released, and if the viewer tries to watch another video before the stream is released, the error is displayed.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Parental controls</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>All content is displayed to end users (in lists, carousels, etc), but when trying to play the video the parental pin will be requested. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Mobile web</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Mobile web has limited support. On devices with a width under 375px a message is displayed to install the appropriate native Brightcove Beacon app.</li>
    </ul>
