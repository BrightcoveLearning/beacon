    <p>A playlist is a collection of videos that are grouped together in a particular order for playback in a player. The Media module makes it easy to create Beacon playlists and add videos to a playlist. After you've created a playlist, you can add it to a page to appear in a Beacon app. </p>

    <h2 id="types">Types of Beacon playlists</h2>
    <p>There are two types of playlists:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Manual</strong> - With a manual playlist, you assign specific videos to the playlist and re-order them manually.</li>
      <li><strong>Smart</strong> - With a smart playlist, the list of videos in the playlist is constructed automatically, based on video tags or other video properties. Smart playlists are dynamic and automatically update based upon the videos in your media library and the rules that define the playlist.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A maximum of 100 videos can be added to a playlist (both Manual and Smart). There is no limit to the number of playlists that can be created. The videos that are initially loaded into a playlist in the player is determined by the type of playlist:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Manual Playlists</strong> - Videos are loaded into the playlist based upon the order of the videos in the manual playlist</li>
      <li><strong>Smart Playlists</strong> - Videos are loaded into the playlist based upon the <strong>Play Order</strong> playlist setting</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For information on programmatically retrieving additional videos into a playlist, see the <a href="https://player.support.brightcove.com/code-samples/brightcove-player-sample-playback-api-paging.html">Playback API Paging</a> player sample.</p>

      <p>If you are creating a Smart playlist, the <strong>Smart</strong> link is used to configure the parameters for the playlist. Parameters are used to determine which assets will be automatically added to the playlist.</p>
      <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/assets/images/media/playlist-smart-settings.png" /></figure>

    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Click <strong>All Beacon playlists</strong> in the panel navigation.</li>
      <li>Locate the playlist and click the playlist name link.</li>

    <h2 id="order">Changing the order of videos in a playlist</h2>
    <p>To change the order of the videos in a playlist, follow the steps based upon the type of playlist you are working with.</p>
    <div class="BCL-subsection">
      <h3>Changing the order of videos in a manual playlist</h3>
      <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
        <li>Click <strong>All Beacon playlists</strong> in the panel navigation.</li>
        <li>Locate the playlist and click the playlist name link. </li>
        <li>The list of videos in the playlist will appear.</li>
        <li><span class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Edit the <strong> Order</strong> field to change to location of the asset in the list.</span></li>
      </ol>

    <div class="BCL-subsection">
      <h3>Changing the order of videos in a smart playlist</h3>
      <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
        <li>Click  <strong>All Beacon playlists</strong>  in the panel navigation.</li>
        <li>Locate the playlist and click the playlist name link.</li>
        <li>Click <strong>Edit Settings</strong>.</li>
        <li>Select a new <strong>Sort Order</strong> for the playlist.</li>
        <li>Click <strong>Apply</strong>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Smart playlists are created dynamically when the player is loaded from the available video information and so the order should always reflect current state. However, the player always gets its info via the Playback API, which uses data cached for up to 20 min. Playlists may take that long to refresh and may be behind what the CMS API would show.</p>
