        </figure> -->
      </li>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Name</strong> - Name for the channel. The name must have English characters and the following special characters are allowed:   _ . : / = + - </li>
          <li><strong>Description</strong> - Channel description</li>
          <li><strong>Image URL</strong> - URL to an image file for the channel; meant to be a channel image that could be retrieved as part of the channel's metadata</li>

      </li>
      <li>Enter the channel <strong>Schedule</strong> details.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Loop Playout Content</strong> - If <strong>On</strong>, the program will be played in a loop and the <strong>End Date/Time</strong> will be enabled.</li>
          <li><strong>Ad Insertion</strong> - If on, allows ads to be displayed during channel playback. If this option is selected, Live inputs are not allowed, and you can only output to a <strong>Brightcove Live Event or</strong> <strong>Amazon S3 Bucket</strong>.</li>
          <li><strong>Start Date/Time</strong> - Time when the channel will start playing out.</li>
          <li><strong>End Date/Time</strong> - If <strong>Loop Playout Content</strong> is selected and there is no <strong>End Date/Time</strong>, the playout will be streamed until the channel is stopped. This time can be updated at any time.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If you will be using Live inputs, set <strong>Live Input</strong> to On, and enter a Slate URL, unless you are going to use the default Brightcove MP4 for your slate. <strong>Note that <strong>the Slate URL must be a static URL that is always available</strong> (short-lived CDN URLs are not allowed).</strong></li>
      <li>Enter the channel <strong>Destination</strong> details. Cloud Playout  supports 2 outputs at the same time. For example, you can output HLS into an S3 Bucket and an RTMP feed to  a Brightcove Live Channel or a 3rd party ingestion point. Note that <strong>Brightcove Live Event</strong> and <strong>RTMP</strong> is not supported.
        <ul>

              <li><strong>Brightcove Live Event</strong> - Create or use a previously created Brightcove Live  Channel. When creating a new channel, the region of the channel will be optimized based upon the <strong>Output Region</strong> that was selected.</li>
              <li><strong>RTMP</strong> - Select to output the stream to an RTMP or RTP ingestion point. RTP is not available for third party ingestion points, only when <strong>Ad Insertion</strong> and <strong>Brightcove Live Event</strong> is enabled. When selected, an <strong>RTMP URL</strong> field will appear - enter the RTMP input URL for your live streaming service.</li>
              <li><strong>Amazon S3 Bucket </strong>- Select to push an HLS output to an Amazon S3 bucket. You will be required to enter Bucket Name, Region, Access Key and Secret Key. The bucket should be public and writeable.</li>
